A script that periodically searches for updates from [FiveThirtyEight](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/), the [Princeton Election Consortium](http://election.princeton.edu) and the [New York Times' Upshot](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html) page. Posts a tweet to [@polforecastbot](https://twitter.com/polforecastbot) whenever an update has occurred.

Built using Python 3.5 and asyncio. Currently set to run every five minutes.
